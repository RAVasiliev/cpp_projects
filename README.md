In tgz file is game manager to game. 

I created problem-oriented language to write a bot to this game (many versions of bots are in txt - files). My programm make syntax and lexic analyze of my code, create RPN and run it. 
As a result - my bot can play with other players (bots or real people) and approximate his turns to make more interesting offers to Manager. 


As a result I wrote 2 versions: stupid robot and clever Robot. Approzimation of clever Robot is better. And It can win every Stupid Robot (1 vs 1 or woth some more players).
